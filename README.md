## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m an Android developer with a strong interest in modern UI/UX design and user-focused app experiences. This repository is part of my journey into Material You, Googleâ€™s latest design system that brings personalization, dynamic theming, and expressive interfaces to Android.

Material You has completely reshaped how I think about app design. Instead of one-size-fits-all interfaces, it encourages adaptive UIs that reflect user preferences and system-wide themes. Iâ€™ve been exploring how to implement dynamic color schemes, custom shapes, and responsive layouts using Jetpack Compose and the latest Android development tools.

This repo includes sample projects and experiments where I apply Material You principlesâ€”from dynamic theming based on the userâ€™s wallpaper to customizing typography, surfaces, and elevation to match system styles. Iâ€™m also diving into how to make apps feel cohesive across devices while maintaining personality and accessibility.

My goal is to build beautiful, functional interfaces that feel natural on modern Android devices, especially on Android 12 and beyond. Along the way, Iâ€™m learning how to balance design flexibility with consistency, and how to implement theming in a way that scales with app complexity.

Each project is documented with the intent to help others who are also learning Material You or looking for practical examples of how to bring their designs to life using the latest Android UI standards.

Thanks for checking out the repository! Whether youâ€™re a fellow developer, designer, or just curious about what Material You can offer, I hope you find inspirationâ€”or something usefulâ€”in the code here. ðŸ’¡ðŸ“±ðŸŽ¨
